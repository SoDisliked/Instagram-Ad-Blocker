# Instagram-Ad-Blocker
A prototype of me making an Ad-Blocker for Web Instagram that is available in Firefox and Chrome. 
This extension hides all ads generated from posts into both home page and Instagram's feed page.
Coded into JS and C# (for now, might use also C++ for getting the extension finalized):
- prototype mode, only personal usage (public usage once finished).
- once release, will try and work for other websites (LinkedIn).
